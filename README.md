# CFD-Analysis-of-Industrial-Melting-Furnace-with-Heat-Transfer-and-Flow-Dynamics
Comprehensive CFD simulation of heat transfer and fluid flow in an industrial melting furnace investigating temperature distribution, flow patterns, and thermal performance optimization.

# Thermal Analysis Objectives
Heat Transfer Investigation

Conduction Analysis: Solid material heat transfer through furnace walls

Convection Effects: Natural/forced convection in furnace interior

Radiation Heat Transfer: High-temperature radiative exchange

Mixed Heat Transfer: Combined conduction-convection-radiation modes

# Flow Dynamics Study

Buoyancy-Driven Flow: Natural convection due to temperature gradients

Recirculation Patterns: Flow circulation zones identification

Velocity Field Analysis: Flow velocity magnitude and direction

Heat Transfer Enhancement: Flow effects on thermal performance

# MATLAB Simulation Methodology
Numerical Methods Implementation

Heat Equation Solver: 2D steady-state heat conduction using finite difference method

Matrix Solution: MATLAB's built-in sparse matrix solvers (mldivide, pcg)

Grid Generation: meshgrid() and linspace() functions for domain discretization

Boundary Conditions: Implemented using MATLAB indexing and matrix manipulation
